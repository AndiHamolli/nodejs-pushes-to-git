# NodeJS pushes to Git

I was bored one day, and I decided use git in a remote server to add, commit, and push lines of randomly 
generated code to a repository that is both
hosted on Bitbucket and on Github.
I also made it create a new branch every time it pushes so that it doesn't overfill the main branch but can add the files elsewhere.
